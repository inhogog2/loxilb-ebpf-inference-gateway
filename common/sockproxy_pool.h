#ifndef __SOCKPROXY_POOL_H__
#define __SOCKPROXY_POOL_H__

/*
 * The lifetime of a pool (proxy_epval_t).
 *
 * A pool is counted: one reference for the listener's table while it is
 * linked, one for each holder. The holders are the fields that keep a pool
 * past one loop iteration of a notify worker: a connection's epv and
 * learn_epv, an HTTP/2 backend session's epv, a capacity permit's fc (it
 * points into the pool), and a thread other than a notify worker that uses a
 * pool after dropping the proxy lock. A holder takes its reference when it
 * is set and gives it back when it is cleared or overwritten.
 *
 * Taking a reference cannot fail. It is legal on a pool the caller already
 * holds, on a pool the caller found in the index during its current loop
 * iteration (a notify worker), and on a pool found linked under the proxy
 * lock (any other thread). A deleted pool's table reference is given back
 * only after a grace period (sockproxy_qsbr.h), so a worker that found it
 * before the unlink still counts from at least one.
 *
 * The last release frees the pool after a grace period, on the reclaimer,
 * under the proxy lock (the finalizer takes it), so that a thread reading a
 * holder's pointer under the lock cannot see it go.
 *
 * The count lives in a header in front of the pool, outside proxy_epval_t.
 *
 * Notify workers read a listener's pools without a lock, through its
 * published index: an immutable snapshot rebuilt under the write lock after
 * every change to the listener's table and freed after a grace period. The
 * table itself (uthash ephash) is read and written only under the lock.
